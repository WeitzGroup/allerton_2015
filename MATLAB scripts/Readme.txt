The main script to run is model_script.m, from which all simulation figures in the
paper is generated. In model_script.m, first run the first cell to initialize the basic
parameters (values of beta and delta, load or generate the contact and information
network). The script is divided into other cells containing the code to generate all
figures in the paper. The 30-node networks on which simulations in the paper are 
performed is included as sample_networks_30_PAPER.mat.

The data used in figure 6 is included as J.mat and U.mat.
